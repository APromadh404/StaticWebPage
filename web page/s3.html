        How to Deal With Homesickness?
     </H2>
     <p>Many students find they miss the comforts of home when they go off to school. Get tips on how to deal with homesickness in college here.</p>
     <P>
        
        Many college students leave home each fall to start the next chapter in their lives. Most public college students enroll in a school within 50 miles of their home. But whether moving across town or across the country, students often find themselves in new surroundings far different from the comforts of home.

            <li><h2>Reach Out to Others for Support</h2>
            <p>
                You may find leaving home and living independently overwhelming at first. The good news is that you're not alone. Other new students may be feeling those same fears and uncertainties.

Talk with your roommates or classmates about feeling homesick at college. Share how you're adjusting to new routines, new surroundings, and new people.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also can turn to older students, such as your resident advisor or someone within your field of study. They can connect you to activities and organizations that can help you build friendships and support networks.

                Another option is to seek out student support resources at your school, such as counseling services.

                <h2>Keep Busy</h2>
                <p>
                    Homesickness at college often gets better in a few weeks as you settle into your new surroundings. One way to speed up that process is to get out of your room and see what the college and community have to offer. Often, you have up to a week to settle in before classes start, so make the most of those first days on campus.

You can also see whether your campus fitness center offers any classes that interest you or join an intramural sports team. Colleges and universities normally organize activities that allow students to mix and mingle during the first few weeks of school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And don't stop at the campus boundary: Seek out parks and recreational opportunities in the surrounding community. Other options are to look for organizations that welcome volunteers or churches and faith communities with activities geared toward college students.

                    Getting involved can help you fill your days and keep your mind off what you miss about home.

                <h2>Give Yourself Time to Adjust</h2>
                <p>
                    Staying active can help ease some of your feelings of homesickness in college. However, you may still have times when you miss the people and places you left behind. Understand that settling into new routines and feeling more comfortable in your new environment can and will take time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers have found that homesickness can last anywhere from three weeks to more than a year. In one study, 94% of students reported experiencing homesickness at some point during their first 10 weeks of college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no quick fix to homesickness — it takes time and patience. Periods of transition, such as returning to school following a break or holiday, can cause those feelings to return. Give yourself time to miss the people and places you left behind.

                <h2>Know That Your Feelings Are Normal</h2>
                
                <p>Many students struggle with feeling homesick at college.</p>
            <p>Homesickness can result from being in a new location, adapting to a new culture, or starting a new routine. It can include missing your family, friends, and even pets. You may miss a special breakfast your family enjoyed on weekends or activities you and your friends took part in before you left home.

                These changes can make students feel anxious. Some students may have trouble sleeping or feel lonely or isolated. You might also experience feelings of grief or depression. Each student experiences homesickness differently. Make sure to get help if these feelings persist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, keep in mind that any change can be difficult, even if it's a positive one. Human brains are wired to take comfort in what's familiar. A period of adjustment should be expected once you get to school.

Talking to someone at your college counseling center could help you acclimate, even if you don't have strong feelings of depression or grief.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Stay in Touch With Friends and Family</h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping in touch with loved ones back home can help you deal with homesickness at college. Technology makes it easy to text, talk, or video chat with friends and family despite the distance. Some students call home 10 times or more a week. 
                </p>
                <p> The college calendar offers breaks you can use to return home, with some schools offering a fall break in October. Holidays typically mean a long weekend as well. If you're only a short drive from your family, you can use those breaks to go home and catch up.

                </p>
                
                    <p>
                        But college life doesn't stop on Friday afternoon — you may need to study or work during the weekend. Weekends also offer opportunities to get involved in clubs and organizations on campus. If you attend a school more than a couple hours from home, returning more often might prove challenging.

                            Strike a balance between returning home and settling into your college environment. Take advantage of opportunities to share your new community with your family or friends by inviting them to visit campus. Playing tour guide can help you become more familiar and feel more at ease with your new living situation.
